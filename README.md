## Description

Using Semantic HTML.  This webpage has been refactored to allow for a more digestible format tha will allow future developers to modify and improve the site for future iterations.

Prior to modifications, the code looked like "div soup" and has a lot of extra bloat, specifically in the style sheet.  I wanted to create more streamlined and easy to digest code for future use.
